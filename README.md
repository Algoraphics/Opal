# Slime Freighter

A work in progress with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

Completion:
- Menu (80%): Needs back button from Road, and sound effects.
- Fractal (98%): Maybe limit ripples so they can't attack people in the eyeballs?
- Ganzfeld (100%)
- Road (40%): 3 more "worlds" to add before the experience is complete.
- About (50%): Well, at least it links to somewhere now.
- Testing (40%): Need VR testing on all devices

Tested on a Vive, smartphone, Chrome, and Firefox 10, but should work on Rift, Gear VR, etc as long as you follow A-Frame conventions for getting WebVR to run.

Follow on-screen instructions on desktop. Open it on a smartphone and use the device motion sensors. Or plug in and start up your VR headset before loading the page.
